The topic of the talk are the results of our recent reproducibility and evaluation articles for neural recommendation approaches published in several high level conferences. Our results show lack of reproducibility and limited competitiveness against simpler and older baseline. The talk focuses on the main issues we encountered while reproducing the results as well as on several methodological problems we could observe (e.g., incorrect data splitting, use of test data during trainingâ€¦) that appear to be very common in the current experimental practice.
