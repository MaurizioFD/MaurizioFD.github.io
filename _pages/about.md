Hello! Computer science engineer by training, I work on the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing as Assistant Professor at Politecnico di Milano, where I am a member of the <a href="http://recsys.deib.polimi.it" target="_blank">RecSys</a> group and the <a href="https://www.quantum.polimi.it/" target="_blank">Quantum Computing Lab</a>.
If you are a student interested in working with us please refer to the <a href="http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/student-faq-work-with-us/" target="_blank">Work With Us</a> page.


### Research interests
My research spans two quite different areas, which I find offer many methods and ideas to draw inspiration from.

* **Quantum Computing**: design of machine learning methods to support the development of quantum computing, including the automatic construction and optimization of ansatzes, qubit mapping, and noise mitigation
* **Recommender Systems**: design and evaluation of algorithms for recommender systems


**RecSys Challenge 2025** Politecnico di Milano’s team, coordinated by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema and Andrea Pisani, won the first prize for the academic track of the RecSys Challenge 2025, sponsored by Synerise!

**QuantumCLEF!** Check out our <a href="[https://openreview.net/forum?id=uFSrUpapQ5K](https://qclef.dei.unipd.it/)" target="_blank"> QuantumCLEF </a> lab! We provide access to a real quantum annealer (D-Wave) to participants, the goal is to develop and test feature selection and clustering algorithms for Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval tasks!
